# FAQ
Below are common questions TA received from students when doing PA1.

* When it shows a green check mark on your GitHub project root page, it shows that you can get the **full** score. You do not need to do extra things since it will
not improve your score further.

* Even if you fail all tests, you can still get 4 points. However, when you have not created your project repository, you will get **zero** point.

* For the second problem, the inverse symbol may be misleading. You should use some other methods to avoid singular cases, just like the first problem.

* Do not modify `test.py` in your submission.

* Do not ask TA about specific implementation of the programming assignments.

* If you cannot create the project repository via the invitation link, please check that you use the right invitation URL. For example, you may misspell the URL by
adding an extra **full stop**.

* If the X mark shows up on your GitHub project root page, please click the X mark to see the error detail.
