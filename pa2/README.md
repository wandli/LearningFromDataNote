# FAQ
Below are common questions TA received from students when doing PA2.

* When it shows a green check mark on your GitHub project root page, it shows that you can get the **full** score (10 points or 12.5 points depending on whether you finish the bonus question). You do not need to do extra things since it will
not improve your score further.

* For the second problem, the weight of mlp classifier has different dimension with theta of logistic regression. However, you have been taught in class that
the weight of softmax regression can be linearly transformed to theta of logistic regression.

* Do not modify `test.py` in your submission.

* You do not need to implement SGD, only building the MLP model in the second problem.

* Do not ask TA about specific implementation of the programming assignments.

* If the X mark shows up on your GitHub project root page, please click the X mark to see the error detail.

* If Due to some unknown reason, the auto-grading is not enabled in the repository of some students. If this happens, please click `Actions -- Enable GitHub Actions` by yourself.
